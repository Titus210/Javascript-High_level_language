## Modular Exponential
Given three numbers x, y, and p, compute (xË†y) % p. (This is
modular exponentiation.) <br/>
Here, x is the base, y is exponent, and p is the modulus.

### Description
Modular exponentiation is a type of exponentiation performed
over a modulus, which is useful in computer science and used in
the field of public-key encryption algorithms
