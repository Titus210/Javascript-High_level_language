# Quote Generator
Quote Generator is a simple web application that generates random quotes using an external API. It displays the quote and the author's name (if available) on the screen and provides a button to share the quote on Twitter.


## Overview
The Quote Generator uses the `fetch()` method to make an HTTP request to an external API, fetches a random quote from the response, 
and displays it on the screen. It also handles cases where the API is not available or there is an error in the response.
The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is responsive to different screen sizes.

## Summary of Project
The Quote Generator project involved using JavaScript to fetch data from an external API and manipulate the DOM to display the data on the screen. 
The project helped to improve my skills in using the `fetch()` method, working with JSON data, and manipulating the DOM

## What I Learned
Through building the Quote Generator, I learned several key concepts, including:

- How to use the fetch() method to make HTTP requests to external APIs
- How to work with JSON data and parse it into JavaScript objects
- How to manipulate the DOM to display data on the screen
- How to use event listeners to respond to user interactions
- How to use CSS to style HTML elements

## Further Development
There are several ways to further develop the Quote Generator application, such as:

- Adding a feature to save favorite quotes
- Allowing users to search for quotes by keyword or author
- Adding more styling to the application to improve the user experience

## Conclusion 
Building the Quote Generator was a valuable learning experience that helped to improve my skills in web development. By using external APIs to fetch data, 
I was able to create a dynamic application that provides users with a fun and engaging experience.
